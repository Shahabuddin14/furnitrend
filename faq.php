      <h4>Furnitrend FAQ</h4><br> <br>
      
      <p><b>Q : </b>How soon will my product be delivered? <br><b>Ans : </b>Delivery times can vary between 24 hours to 7 days depending on the package. This information will be available on the Product Details Page.<p>
      
      <p><b>Q : </b> Do you set up the furniture? <br><b>Ans : </b> Yes, we do. Our delivery team installs and lays out the items as per your instructions.</p>
      
      <p><b>Q : </b> Can I choose the delivery date and time? <br><b>Ans : </b>You can share your preferred delivery time with us. If furniture availability is not an issue, our team will comply with your request.</p>
      
      
      
     <p><b>Q : </b> Do I have to pay for deliveries and pick-ups? <br><b>Ans : </b> All our deliveries and pick-ups are free of cost. So you do not need to pay anything apart from the monthly subscription fee.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> What documents are to be provided before my furniture package is delivered? <br> <b>Ans : </b>The documents are : <br><b> 1. </b> NID Card or any PHOTO ID <br><b>2. </b> Rental Agreement <br><b>3. </b> Latest Bank Statement <br><b>4. </b> Latest Phone Bill</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b>How can I share these documents? <br><b>Ans : </b>After you place your order, youâ€™ll receive a link in an email that will lead you to a page where you can upload these documents.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> What happens if I damage or break the furniture? <br><b>Ans : </b> We provide damage cover up to BT.10,000 for accidental damages. Please note that this covers only furniture and not appliances. Our internal team will assess the level of damage and conclude if it can be covered within the policy or not. Any damage that makes the furniture/appliances dysfunctional is chargeable.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> Can I replace any of the products? <br><b>Ans : </b>Let us know if the furniture or appliance is not in a working condition anymore and we'll arrange for a replacement as soon as possible. The replacement process is only applicable to furniture and appliances. You can replace your soft furnishings once a year if they show signs of color fading or any other kind of damage.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> How many days does it take to avail your services like Deep Cleaning, Relocation and Termination? <br><b>Ans : </b>Please provide us with 14-days prior and we will be happy to accommodate your request.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> What happens if I face any issue with my existing subscription products (furniture/appliances)? <br><b>Ans : </b>Simply let us know if the furniture or appliance is not in a working condition anymore and we'll arrange for a replacement as soon as possible. So, live worry-free with our furniture.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b>What if I am not completely satisfied with furniture after delivery? <br><b>Ans : </b> You can choose to opt for a refund at the time of delivery in the event you are unhappy with your furniture</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> Is there any advance or deposit required? What would be my deposit amount? <br><b>Ans : </b> A refundable security deposit of 1 month is required for all bookings.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> What happens to my deposit amount? <br><b>Ans : </b> Your deposit amount is refunded at the end of your subscription period. Any furniture damage in excess of BDT 10,000 is adjusted against your deposit.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b>What happens if I make a late payment? <br><b>Ans : </b> Delayed payment of monthly rentals beyond the due date will lead to a penalty of 5% of the outstanding amount, whichever is the higher amount. Non-payment of monthly rentals for two consecutive months could result in termination of the subscription and pickup of the furniture.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> What payment modes can be used to complete the payment? <br><b>Ans : </b> You may use debit card, credit card or even net banking to complete your payment.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b>Can I purchase the furniture after my rental tenure? <br><b>Ans : </b> It is a rental plan and therefore you cannot purchase the same after the rental period. However, if you want to change the look of your home and extend your rental plan then you can swap with any of our other furniture designs with no extra cost added.</p>
     
     <p><b>Q : </b> Can I take it for a short term basis? <br><b>Ans : </b> No, the minimum duration is 6 months, post which you can terminate the subscription anytime after giving a notice period of 14 days.</p>
